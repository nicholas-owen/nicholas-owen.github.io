The CRB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the normal development and function of the retina. This protein helps to regulate the number and arrangement of light-sensitive cells in the retina. Variants in CRB1 disrupt the normal function of this protein, leading to the death of light-sensitive cells and as a result, people with CRB1 eye disease experience a progressive loss of vision. There is currently no cure for this disorder 2.\nCRB1 genetic variants source: gnomAD Leber’s congenital atrophy (LCA) is a form of inherited blindness that is caused by the death of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is another inherited blindness that is caused by the degeneration of the retina. Both conditions can result from variants in CRB1 and may lead to complete blindness.

With further developments in sequencing approaches, new high throughput methods, and reduction in resources required, the average cost of sequencing the human genome of an individual has been reduced from $2 billion to approximately £700 2.\nGenome sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of biology and has had a major impact on many areas of science and medicine. For example, it has led to the development of new cancer therapies and has helped us to better understand the evolution of viruses.\nIn partnership with the NHS, Genomics England intially was setup to provide 100,000 whole genomes set out by the UK government in 2015.

This is commonly used to study gene expression patterns in a number of organisms; including human, animals and plants, in order to further understand genetic mechanisms underlying phenotype determination, diseases and results of environmental changes. Not only can RNA-seq analysis be used for gene expression, transcript modelling including the identification of novel expressed isoforms or alternative exon usage has become more popular. Examination of the long non-coding RNA atlas (lncRNA) and micro RNAs (miRNA) can readily be carried out using specific RNA-seq approaches. Combined with DNA-seq SNPs have been studied with feature expression data to identify expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) via GWAS mapping or allele-specific expression (ASE) (for example the human GTEx Consortium, 2020).\nWith the phenomenon of RNA editing, where a nucleotide change can be observed at the RNA level, post DNA transcription, it is possible that variants can only be observed at the RNA level, absent at DNA level (such as WGS or WES). Therefore RNA-seq can also detect genomic variants in expressed regions of the genome, in addition to DNA-seq. With the current costs of RNA-seq per sample around £300 for 75M paired end reads (150bp), RNA-seq is an attractive approach for variant discovery.\nAlthough there are clear advantages in using RNA-seq data for coding region SNP detection, it is not commonly carried out.

The molecular and cellular mechanisms that facilitate optic fissure fusion remain elusive. We have profiled global gene expression during optic fissure morphogenesis by transcriptome analysis of tissue dissected from the margins of the zebrafish optic fissure and the opposing dorsal retina before (32 hours post fertilisation, hpf), during (48 hpf) and after (56 hpf) optic fissure fusion. Differential expression analysis between optic fissure and dorsal retinal tissue resulted in the detection of several known and novel developmental genes. The expression of selected genes was validated by qRT-PCR analysis and localisation investigated using in situ hybridisation. We discuss significantly overrepresented functional ontology categories in the context of optic fissure morphogenesis and highlight interesting transcripts from hierarchical clustering for subsequent analysis. We have identified netrin1a (ntn1a) as highly differentially expressed across optic fissure fusion, with a resultant ocular coloboma phenotype following morpholino antisense translation-blocking knockdown and downstream disruption of atoh7 expression. To support the identification of candidate genes in human studies, we have generated an online open-access resource for fast and simple quantitative querying of the gene expression data. Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the zebrafish optic fissure transcriptome and provides a valuable resource to facilitate our understanding of the complex aetiology of ocular coloboma.","tags":["RNA-seq","transcriptomics","coloboma","zebrafish","optic fissure"],"title":"Transcriptome profiling of zebrafish optic fissure fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Owen"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
